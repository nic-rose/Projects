# Activities
## Letter Selection
Four letters are shown at the bottom of the page. The verse is shown with a certain number of blanks, the lengths of which are relative to the word. Previously filled blanks are the same font as the verse but retain the underline. If the incorrect letter is chosen, the button says "wrong" and the user can choose again. 
## Word Selection
Two choices are at the bottom. The verse is shown with a certain number of blanks. Previously filled blanks are the same format as the verse. If the wrong choice is selected, the button will show an "X", then the user can try again.
## Lily Pads
The screen will display three rows of two sets of buttons, each with a different word from the text. When the correct word is selected, the button turns and remains green. If the user selects the incorrect word, the button turns red and the user gets to choose the correct word. After the user finishes the third row, the next three will be shown. The last three words of the verse on previous lily pads will be shown on the bottom of the screen.
