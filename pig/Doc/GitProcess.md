# Git Process
All software gets commited to master, including bug fixes. 
If a merge conflict does occur then the person merging must resolve the conflict. 
Any software that is commited must also work so it does not handicap the rest of the group's building and testing.  
Any software that does not work should be pushed to a seperate branch then merged to master after the software is working.
