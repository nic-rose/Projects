## In Depth Analysis

 - inorder (Tree, In)
 Returns true when In is a list containing in inorder traversal of Tree.

 - subtree (S,T)
 Returns true when S is a subtree of T.  This also returns true when S == T.

 - ordered (Tree)
 Verifies if Tree is a binary search tree without duplicates.

 - search (Tree, Key)
 Returns true if element key appears in Tree.

 - substitute (X, Y, TreeX, TreeY)
 Returns true where TreeY is the result of replacing all occurrences of X in TreeX by element Y.
